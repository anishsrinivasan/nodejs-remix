# NodeJS Remix

Build Highly Scalable Backend with NodeJS.

###### Typescript | Express | TypeORM | JWT | Dependency Injection | mySQL | Mongoose | Postgres

\
It all started as a problem, choosing a good architecture is a real pain and to make matter worse we have multiple options to choose from, There are around hundreds or thousands of boilerplates which are widely available and each follow different pattern, so we started to study and learn the best practices which has been used by top frameworks & boilerplates and also maintaing a good generic coding practices such as DRY, KISS, S.O.L.I.D to come up with something simple, clean framework and with an only intention to make the developer's life easier.

## Features

- Easy to Start
- Highly Scalable
- Supports all types of modern databases (TypeORM)
- Built using Typescript
- SSL / HTTPS

## Follows Best Practices

- 3 Layers Architecture - Routes/Controllers, Services & Repository (Data Layer)
- Clean Project Folder Structure
- Publisher Subscriber Models (Work in Progress)
- Clean Code & Easy Readability
- Write Asynchronous Code
- Configuration files and Environment Variables
- Testing, Logging & Error Handling
- Dependency Injection

## Tech

NodeJS Remix uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Typescript
- Express
- NodeJS
- dotEnv
- CORS
- Joi
- JWT
- mySQL
- TypeORM
- TypeDI
- SocketIO
- Winston

And of course NodeJS Remix itself is open source on GitHub.
